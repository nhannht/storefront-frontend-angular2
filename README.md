For someone want to check my code, I snapshot the workspace and public it to gitpod. It will ensure we not deal with dependences hell or something like that. Just run `yarn install` , `ng server` and you will see deployed project, please wait some seconds for the latence of network. Notice that this is just a snapshot for examine purpose

`ng server` to build and run it in development mode.
`ng test` if you need to do something with testing.
There is nothing special to say
